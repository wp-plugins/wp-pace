Cool Features:

* Customize the color of the progress bar with an easy to use color picker
* Choose which progress bar 'theme' you want to use from a dropdown list
* Decide whether you want to have the progress bar on every page or use the shortcode to add it to just a few specific pages/posts
* The shortcode allows you to have different colored progress bars with varying themes on a page to page basis.

How to use the shortcode:

There are two attributes you can use

*   color
*   theme

Example: `[pace color="#29d9dd" theme="minimal"]` or just `[pace]` will work fine. (the default color is #29d9dd and the default theme is minimal)

There are ten themes to choose from

* Minimal
* Flash
* Barbershop
* MacOSX
* Fill-Left
* Flat-Top
* CornderIndicator
* Bounce
* Big Counter
* Center Circle

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How big is this plugin? =

Currently it's sitting at: ~43.3KB
This is largely due to the fact that every pace theme is included in this plugin.  That's not to say that every theme is loaded.  Only the theme you choose is loaded onto your page.
